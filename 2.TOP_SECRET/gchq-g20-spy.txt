Economic crisis [edited for classiﬁcation]

Sigint continues to provide occasional high-value, sensitive and timely reports.

More strategically, a key focus for the Prime Minister is the 620 heads of state
meeting in London on 2 April. He is determined to use the meeting to make

progress on two objectives:

- to coordinate the global economic recovery to avoid the recession becoming a

depression

- to agree the way fonNard on strengthening global economic governance and

achieving reform of international financial institutions.

The GCHQ intent is to ensure that intelligence relevant to HMG’s desired outcomes
for its residenc of the (320 reaches customers at the ri ht time and in a form which

allows them to make full use of it.
