What is TOR?

- “The Onion Router”

- Hides source of traffic by passing encrypted
versions of your internet traffic between multiple

TOR routers

- Notation:
— “Client” — the initiator of communication
— “Guard node" — the TOR router the client contacts

— “Exit node" — the TOR router that relays your traffic to
the final destination (with no extra encryption so this
link can be exploited by SIGINT system)

Who uses TOR?

- TOR was created by the US government and is
now maintained by the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF)

° EFF will tell you there are many pseudo-legitimate
uses for TOR

- We’re interested as bad people use TOR, in
particular:

— Terrorists
— Paedophiles

Aim
- Find client IP address associated with TOR
exit node traffic
- Attack based on externals — specifically packet
timings
— Strong crypt is being used

Aim
- We’ll make our task easier by assuming we own

the exit node being used

— Allows us to see all the traffic associated with a TOR
circuit
— Demultiplex traffic by (unknown) user

Side note: Circuit tracing

- One suggestion was to track packets through each
hop in the TOR network

- We experimented with spotting all links in circuits
created by GCHQ

- Visibility was too low to be a sensible approach
— 13 out of 8294 potential inter-TOR-router links were seen

- We will directly correlate:
— exit node traffic, and
— traffic between client and guard node

Test data collection

- Used the standard “TOR button" web-browser
package to access TOR

- Made minor changes to ensure we could collect exit
node traffic
1. "News": Search for news, visit news websites

2. “TOR”: Browse the TOR website and then use a privacy
checking website
° Split into 2a and 2b as TOR changed circuit mid-way through

1. “Download”: visit to SlashDot followed by downloading a
large PDF file.

2. "Forum": Search on Google followed by browsing a PC
technical help forum.

Flattening of timing patterns

- _(lCTR-NE) observed that TOR can
flatten out timing patterns

° TOR uses a rate-limiting store-and-forward
procedure at each TOR router

- Graph shows bytes of exit node traffic in green
and client traffic in red whilst downloading a 1MB

Scoring: basic idea

° An idea of —

— Bin time into intervals
— For each interval get a pair (E, G.)

- Cumulative exit node packets upto time i
- Cumulative guard node packets upto time i

— Measure the correlation between these pairs
- We use is time-windows

— Easy for the SIGINT system

— Seems to work

Scoring: refinements

UK TOP SECRET STRAP1 COMINT
Scoring: refinements

- There may be an unknown time-offset
— Traffic takes time to relay through the TOR network
— SIGINT clocks may not be synchronised

— We slide the traces against each other and find the best
match

— Truncate to exit node trace (we know that it is a
complete TOR circuit)

False positives

Want an algorithm with very low false positive rate

Used 2 hours of (timestamp, source IP, destination
IP) tuples captured from 4 106 internet bearers

Filtered to tuples between a guard node and a non-
TOR node

Allow time to arbitrarily slide +/- 2 hours
— In real redeployment one would restrict this slide

Allow us to plot ROC curves for the technique

A larger experiment

- We want to find some false hits to understand worst
case accuracy for the server-to-client direction

- Let’s open the aperture very wide
— 2027 bearer hours of logs with any time slide
— Filter to all traffic involving a TOR node
- Not just likely guard-to-client traffic as before

- We find some false hits (540) but rate is assessed
to be low enough.

- 92% of false hits are against the big download
session which has little structure

The next step

- We are collecting the required logs of packet
times with TOR guard nodes in SIGINT

- GTE / JTRIG have adapted some TOR exit nodes
we own to collect the required exit node data
— We are keen to engage with others with exit nodes too

° Then run the attack
— Expect to basically work

— Some extra work might be required to only allow
queries on sessions with enough structure
° Need the bulk data first to progress this question

R package

- An R iackaie can be downloaded from

- Includes algorithm and the collected web-browsing
data

- Recommend R packages for sharing analytics, can
contain:
— R / C / Fortran code
— Example data
— Runnable examples and documentation
— Unit tests

Conclusion

- Have shown a potential externals-based
deanonymisation attack for TOR

— Requires SIGINT collection of guard-to-client packet
times

— Requires TOR collection from exit nodes we own
- Hope to get this running live at GCHQ soon

- Full paper and software available from
