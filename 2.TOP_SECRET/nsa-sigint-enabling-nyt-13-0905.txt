Secret Documents Reveal N.S.A. Campaign Against Encryption

Documents show that the N.S.A. has been waging a war against encryption using a battery of methods that include working
with industry to weaken encryption standards, making design changes to cryptographic software, and pushing international

encryption standards it knows it can break. Related Article »

Excerpt from 2013 Intelligence Budget Request Bullrun Briefing Sheet

This excerpt from the N.S.A.’s 2013 budget request outlines the ways in which the agency circumvents the encryption
protection of everyday Internet communications. The Sigint Enabling Project involves industry relationships, clandestine
changes to commercial software to weaken encryption, and lobbying for encryption standards it can crack.

The N.S.A.‘s Sigint Enabling Project is a $250 million-
a—year program that works with Internet companies to
weaken privacy by inserting back doors into encryption
products. This excerpt from a 2013 budget proposal
outlines some methods the agency uses to undermine
encryption used by the public.

The agency works with companies to insert back doors
into the commercial products. These back doors allow the
agency, and in theory only the agency, to gain access to
scrambled information that it would not be able to view
otherwise.

Because the N.S.A has long been considered the world‘s
top authority on encryption, it has dual, sometimes
competing, roles. One responsibility of the agency is to
safeguard United States communications by promoting
encryption standards, and the other is to break codes
protecting foreign communications. Part of the Sigint
Enabling Project‘s goal is to influence these standards —
which are often used by American companies — and
weaken them.
