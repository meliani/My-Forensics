(S//Sl//REL) For Normal SIGINT flow, need to identify Tor traffic!
— (S/lSl//REL) Only outer TLS layer visible —) How to Distinguish?

— (S//S|//REL) Tor developers attempt to remain anonymous by blending in
with myriad other TLS traffic

(S//S|//REL) Tor TLS has changed over the years

(S//Sl//REL) There ARE some server —> client features which are
recognizable

w (S//Sl//REL) Certificate: Specific Difﬁe-He/lman (DH) Modulus — byte search

(S//Sl//REL) Certificate: Issuer and Subject random names of same form — ex:
CN=www.ofszdjxvrss.net — regex match

(S//Sl//REL) Certificate: always 2 hour lifetime — ASN.1 parsing, more computation
e (S//Sl) Multiple XKS fingerprints from multiple parties deployed

- (S//REL) Claim by Tor Project is 8000 requests/day for <1000 total
(S//REL)Around Feb 2011, changed the TLS handshake
(

S/IREL) Signature more like Apache web-server
(S//REL) Different DH Modulus
(S/lSll/REL) New XKS Signatures address this
(TS//S|//REL) Proposed eventual change will kill identification!

(S//REL) Each Tor node will generate random-ish signatures in a volatile
way specifically designed to look like normal website TLS traffic!

(S//REL Extreme Censorship blocking: Common encrypted protocols
(S//REL) In the case of Psiphon 3: SSH
(S//REL) In the case of Tor. TLS
(S//REL) Make deep packet inspection (XKS 2-) ) work harder
(Sl/REL) Both use work of a open source project (brl/obfuscated-openssh)
 (S//REL Idea is both sides transmit random seed and verifier information
I (S//REL) Verifier is hash of seed and other data
a". (Sl/REL) If verifier passes data used from both side seeds to generate key
(S//REL) Key used in symmetric cipher to encrypt native SSH or SSL protocol
(S//REL) So for random stream, need to de-obfuscate and test for SSH/ SSL
(S//REL) Details for Psiphon 3
- (S//REL) Hash used for verifier, key generation: 6000 iterations SHA-1
- (S//REL) Symmetric cipher is RC-4
(S//REL) Details for Tor Obsfproxy
- (SI/REL) Hash used for verifier, key generation: 100K iterations SHA-256
- (S//REL) Symmetric cipher is AES-CTR-128
- (S//REL) Key uses seed from both sides!
