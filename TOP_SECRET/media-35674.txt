Summary of Intelligence
Community Applications
(U/lFOUO)

 

 
     

Covert Communications (TS/ISl/IREL)

(TS/ISl/IREL) Provide covert comms in denied areas
where no infrastructure exists, or where using the
infrastructure would compromise the operation.

(S/IREL) Several “brush-pass" wireless hand-offs as
an untraceable alternative to scheduled meetings,
dead drops.

(TS/ISl/IREL) DTN provides an open-source solution
running on commercial handheld devices z.

Close Access (TS/lSl/IREL)

- (TS//S|//REL) Implant in a secure
facility or denied area

- (TS//S|//REL) Need to transfer data
and commands over two or more
hops

- (TS//S|//REL) May rely on mobile
nodes and unwitting data mules

 

 

(TS//S|//TK) Moving data between ground stations using CubeSats.
Coverage every ~l.5 hours. Need DTN

(TS/lSI/lTK) They use DTN2, ION, contact graph routing

STRAITBIZZARE (U)

(TS/ISI/IREL) Cross-platform implant built using TAO’s
CHIMNEYPOOL framework

— Ports for Linux, Windows, etc..
— Endpoint-centric : focused on file exfil from a PC
— Remote Procedure Call (RPC) based

(TS/lSll/REL) FRIEZERAMP protocol provides covert
networking

- CHIMNEYPOOL comms module
- Similar to IP, IPsec
- Only supports static network configuration

(TS//S|//REL) FRIEZERAMP links are adapters to
converge FR packets onto the transport layer below

- Examples : https, udp, smtp, etc.

 

 
     

Put SBZ on each device  right?
(TS/IS l// RE L)

(TS//Sl//REL) File exfil CP modules and FRIEZERAMP
treats reliability as only an end-to-end issue

— FR retransmissions are requested by the receiver
and only the sender can retransmit

— Hop-by-hop reliability is desirable

(TSl/S|//REL) Persistent storage module only waits until
link is available then “send and forget"

(U//FOUO) All routes are static and setup a priori

(TS//Sl//REL) Operationally, SBZ on each device is
undesirable in some CONOPs

- (TS//Sl//REL) —has been building

an ultra-lightweight BPA that can act as a CP
link to a DTN

- (U//FOUO) Locally provides data persistence,
discovery, routing, convergence layers

- (TS//Sl//REL) FR packets are already
fragmented, so this BPA does not need to be as
flexible as others

- (S//REL)Can add covert Convergence Layer

Routing in DTNs (U)

 

 
     

Flood Routing and Epidemic (U)

- 2000: Epidemic Routing [Vahdat and
Becker]

 

 

Static Routing Background (U)

- Bundle Protocol Nodes are identified by Endpoint
Identifiers (Ele) that look like:

dtn://dtnbone.umd.edu.dtn/
dtn://nodea.dtn/
ebr://group5.dtn/

- Convergence Layer connections to neighbors are
called "Links"
— For example a TCP connection to a neighbor is a link

- Each link knows the EID of the neighbor associated
with it

Security in DTNs (U)

 

 
     

Security Threats (U)

- (TSl/Sll/REL) Protecting against rogue bundles being
injected into the network

- (TS//Sl//REL) Prevent an adversary from modifying
legitimate bundles

- (S/lREL) Protection against eavesdroppers
- (S/lREL) Authenticate neighbors before establishing links
- (TSl/Sll/REL) Low Probability of Detection / Intercept

- (U) Provides bundle-layer encryption,
authentication, and data integrity

- (U) Lack of connectivity affects choice
of algorithms and services

- (U) Security polices may be directional

- (U//FOUO) Managing keys and their
accompanying policies is a challenge

 

 

- (U) Hop-by-hop Authentication

- (U) Requires each device to generate a shared secret with
each of its neighbors

- (U//FOUO) Establishing these keys is a challenge

- (U//FOUO) End-to-end authentication
— RSA digital signatures

- (U) Intermediate nodes can verify the
signature

- (U) Cannot assume connectivity to an
external Certificate Authority

- (U) For signatures, the certificate can
be appended to the message

- (U//FOUO) Payload data encrypted
with AES in Galois Counter Mode

(GCM)
- (U) Provides data integrity

- (U) AES key is encrypted with the
destination’s RSA public key

 

 
     

Key Management Issues (U)

- (U) How to distribute public keys securely
- (U//FOUO) One option: pass certificates between devices

- (U//FOUO) Another option: pre-placing certificates
— Memory issues

- (U) Revoking keys of compromised devices

 

 

 
   

Link-Layer Security (U)

(U//FOUO) Even with BSP, CL is wide open

(U//FOUO) Develop a mechanism to authenticate
neighbors before allowing them to connect

Enables dropping unwanted bundles
May prevent DoS through too many connections

(Ul/FOUO) Enable different groups of nodes to operate in
the same area but maintain separation

- (TS//Sl//REL) Have set up external
triggers for establishing DTN links

- (S//REL) Similar work being done
outside to reduce power consumption

- (U) Example: Bluetooth beacons
triggering a wifi connection

- (SI/REL) Another option: use our own
radios for some hops
