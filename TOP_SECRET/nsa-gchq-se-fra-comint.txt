evolved technical SIGINT issues for both COMINT and ELINT. In 2004 we mutuall}r agreed that our 50-year—old arrangement was no longer operable since we:

(TS:"."'SI) Therefore: we drafted a paper that was signed by NSA's Principal Director for Foreign Aﬂ‘airs: GCHQ'S head of Foreign Relations: and the Director General of Sweden's SIGINT Service  allowing NSA
to deal with the FRA on COMINT issues without pre-coordination with GCHQ. The paper also requires both of us to keep the other informed as to what we are doing with the FRA: and requires the F RA to dedupe If
both GCHQ and we are separately asking for the same or similar exchanges. As a result of this change: our COMJNT relationship with the F RA has burgeoned on both sides. The relationship with Sweden is protected at

the TOP SECRET level because of that nation's political neutrality.
