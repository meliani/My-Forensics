(UIIFOUO) Executive Summary

(Sl/Sl/IREL USA, FVEY) This paper discusses the work completed as of 1 April
2008 on the inclusion of CNE data into the CT10 Pilot Project. CTlO engaged two
fronts in this effort. First, was the acquisition and alerting of active SIGINT into
CT‘O. Second, was the design of an extension to the current CT10 data model to
support further analytic development of CNE data. As a result of this work, CT10
now supports alerting of the establishment of new TAO points of presence on the
Internet with respect to certain exploitation methodologies. Additionally, this
paved the road with internal and external partners for the continued development
of the CT10 CNE data model extension.

(Sl/Sl/IREL USA, FVEY) Specific conclusions and recommendations are
contained at the close of this paper. However, three key points underpin a
majority of the information in this paper:

0 (Ul/FOUO) Priority support to CT10 data acquisition efforts.

- (Ul/FOUO) Further building a DNl/CNE analytic and development team.

0 (Sl/Sl/IREL USA, FVEY) Development of a strategic vision for use of CNE
data in CT").

(UIIFOUO) TAO Data Flow Acquisition

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) The first step in processing CNE data is to identify and
acquire CNE data flows in order to route this information into CT“). This work
presents its own unique challenges,, as described in the next section.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) CT10 is ingesting a single flow of CNE data, specifically
FOXACID log files. This was identified as a top priority by CT10 customers
GHOSTWolf, therefore it was chosen to be the first CNE data flow to pursue.
After mapping the flow of FOXACID data throughout NSA, CT10 established a
flow of this data from Protocol Exploitation starting in the middle of February
2008.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) Because the CNE data model extension had not been
implemented at this time, the only way to process FOXACID logs was to fit the
information into the current CT10 data model. This was possible primarily
because of the natural flexibility in the current model. It was easy to define a new
“event type” within the CT10 ingestion system, and populate events with all
selectors pulled from the each FOXACID event. Another benefit of the current
model design was that it became easy to define a new selector type for an
implant ID and easily integrate it into the system. This allows implant IDs to be
added to watch lists and as target selectors, so that CT10 users can track any
events that are associated with a defined set of implants. Therefore, if CT10
acquired a data flow containing implant callback information, it would be easy to
add this into the current data model, giving analysts additional capability to follow
implants deployed through FOXACID.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) As a result of this work, the CT10 system is now alerting
on FOXACID exploitation activity through a suite of alerting technologies. This
includes geo-locational tipping in GeoT, and alerting through Agent Logic (IRC
and e-mails) and the iSpace dashboard.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) One conclusion reached from developing the FOXACID
ingestion code is that the current CT10 data model can support more CNE data
than previously believed. As new CNE flows are introduced into the system, it
may be possible to easily add them to the current data model if the extension is
still not implemented.

(UIIFOUO) Near and Long Term Goals for TAO Data Flow
Acquisition

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) The near term goal regarding CNE data flow into CT10 is
to identify additional CNE data flows that build off of the FOXACID data. Based
on the requirements of GHOSTWolf, the immediate next step would be to acquire
implant callback data flows. This would allow analysts to track when their
implants are calling back to listening posts for tasking and exfiltration. The
implants in question are VALIDATOR, OLYUMPUS, UNITEDRAKE, and
STRAITBIZZARE.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) After establishing this data flow, the next step would be
to ingest collected data from the implants. This includes any exfiltrated files, and
implant plug-in results. With each new data flow, CT10 analysts will have a more
complete picture of CNE activity related to their targets. However, these types of
data do not naturally fit into the current data model, which is why the proposed
extension is so important.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) Additionally, there are other CNE datasets not created
by TAO that would be useful to CT analysts. GOLLUM, a partner implant, is one
such data set that GHOSTWolf has indicated that would be useful to ingest into
CTl". RADIUS logs (ISP dial up customer records) are also an excellent source
of information, and create a natural link between DNR and DNI datasets.

(U) Challenges I Way Ahead

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) There are a number of challenges for securing further
CNE data from TAO. First, given the complexity of TAO data flow, locating the
ultimate data owner is challenging. Though everyone in TAO CT10 has interacted
with on data flow issues has been extremely helpful, no new CNE flows have
been established. This is largely due to the fact that CT10 is not imbedded within
the requirements generation process in TAO. Additional transparency on TAO
data flow requirements will greatly ease this issue.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) One other issue that would greatly help other systems in
using TAO data, is a universal marking and classification of CNE data. In the
case of FOXACID, there are no native classification markings on the files, and
compartmented targets as well as FISA data have to be stripped out by TAO
before data is sent on to external customers such as CT“). As CT10 becomes PL3
accredited, it becomes critical that CT10 ingests fu|| FOXACID records.
Unfortunately, the lack of a unique marking and classification for each file creates
additional challenges that complicate the oversight, classification and policy
surrounding CNE data. Furthermore, additional discussions with TAO have
indicated that this may be an issue for other data flows as well. The addition of
classification markings to TAO data feeds would greatly assist all consumers of
TAO data with maintaining the proper security procedures.

(Ul/FOUO) TAO engineers have worked towards creating an RDF database
system that would house all of their information, and make it available to external
customers. As this capability is developed, CT10 could benefit greatly from
becoming a consumer of this data. This system would address a number of
issues, including the marking and classification challenge addressed in the
previous paragraph.

(SI/SIIIREL USA, FVEY) In summary, the way ahead is to address these existing
challenges in order to effectively push more TAO data flows out to analysts in
near real time. CTlO should also remained synched with TAO‘s effort to develop
and deploy the RDF database. Finally, CTlO needs to implement the data model
extension and move any currently ingested TAO data into the new model.
