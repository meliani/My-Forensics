1U! DEFINITIONS:

(U//FOUO) Information security device or system: A device or system that provides any of the following services for
communications or information systems: confidentiality, data integrity, authentication and authorization.

(U//FOUO) Cryptanalytic vulnerability: A flaw in the design, implementation or system integration of cryptography used in an
information security device, or a ï¬‚aw in the way that a cryptographic information security device is used.

(U//FOUO) Unintended cryptographic vulnerability: Security is less than advertised by the manufacturer.

(U/lFOUO) Indigenous: Non-commercial cryptographic information security system or device developed by a SIGINT target.
