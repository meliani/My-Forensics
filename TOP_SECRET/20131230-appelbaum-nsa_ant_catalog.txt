(T SIISIfIREL T0 USAFVEY) Audio-based RF retro-reflector. Provides room
audio from targeted space using radar and basic post-processing.
(U) Capabilities

(T SffSIIIREL TO USA.FVEY) LOUDAUTO's
current design maximizes the gain of the
microphone. This makes it extremely useful for
picking up room audio. It can pick up speech at

a standard. ofﬁce volume from over 20' away.
(NOTE: Concealments may reduce this distance.)
It uses very little power (—15 uA at 3.0 VDC). so
little. in fact. that battery self-discharge is more of
an issue for serviceable lifetime than the power
draw from this unit. The simplicity of the design
allows the form factor to be tailored for speciﬁc
operational requirements. All components at
COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA.

(U) Concept of Operation

TSHSIIIREL TO USAFVEY) Room audio is picked up by the microphone and
converted into an analog electrical signal. This signal is used to pulse position
modulate (PPM) a square wave signal running at a pre-set frequency. This
square wave is used to turn a PET (field effect transistor) on and off. When
the unit is illuminated with a CW signal from a nearby radar unit. the
illuminating signal is amplitude-modulated with the PPM square wave. This
signal is re-radiated. where it is picked up by the radar, then processed to
recover the room audio. Processing is currently performed by COTS
equipment with FM demodulation capability (Rohde a Schwarz FSH-series
portable spectrum analyzers. etc.) LOUDAUTO is part of the
ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar retro-reﬂectors.

(TSIISIHREL TO USA.FVEY) NIGHTWATCH is a portable computer with
specialized. internal hardware designed to process progressive-scan (non-
interlaced) VAGRANT signals.

(U) Capability Summary

(TSHSIIJREL TO USAFVEY) The current
implementation of NIGHTWATCH consists of
a general-purpose PC inside of a shielded
case. The PC has PCI digitizing and clock
cards to provide the needed interface and
accurate clocking rqued for video
reconstrucﬁon. It also has:

- horizontal sync. vertical sync and video
outputs to drive an external. multi-sync
monitor.

* video input

- spectral analysis up to 150 kHz to provide for indications of horizontal and
vertical sync frequencies

- frame capture and forwarding

- PCMCIA cards for program and data storage

- horizontal sync locking to keep the display set on the NIGHTWATCH display.
- frame averaging up to 2‘16 (65536) frames.

(U) Concept of Operation

(TSHSIIIREL T0 USAFVEY) The video output from an appropriate collection
system. such as a CTX4000. PHOTOANGLO. or general-purpose receiver. is
connected to the video input on the NIGHTWATCH system. The user. using the
appropriate tools either within NIGHTWATCH or externally. determines the
horizontal and vertical sync frequencies of the targeted monitor. Once the user
matches the proper frequencies. he activates "Sync Lock" and frame averaging
to reduce noise and improve readability of the targeted monitor. If warranted. the
user then fomrards the displayed frames over a network to NSAW. where
analysts can look at them for intelligence purposes.

Unit Cost: NIA

Status: This system has reached the end of its service life. All work concerning
the NIGHTWATCH system is strictly for maintenance purposes. This system is
slated to be replaced by the VIEWPLATE system.

generates an un-modulated. continuous wave (CW) signal. The oscillator is
either generated internally. or externally through a signal generator or cavity
oscillator. The unit ampliﬁes the signal and sends it out to an RF connector.
where it is directed to some form of transmission antenna (horn. parabolic dish.
LPA. spiral). The signal illuminates the target system and is re-radiated. The
receive antenna picks up the re-radiated signal and directs the signal to the
receive input. The signal is amplified. filtered. and mixed with the transmit
antenna. The result is a homodyne receiver in which the RF signal is mixed
directty to baseband. The baseband video signal is ported to an external BNC
connector. This connects to a processing system. such as NIGHTWATCH. an
LFS-Z. or VIEWPLATE. to process the signal and provide the intelligence.

_—

(TSﬂSIﬂREL TO USA.FVEY) Beacon RF retro-reﬂector. Provides return 07 Apr 2009
when illuminated with radar to provide rough positional location.

(U) Capabilities
(TSHSWREL T0 USA.FVEY) TAWDRYYARD is 32N03
used as a beacon. typically to assist in locating a 16

and identifying deployed RAGEMASTER units. 4 12 20
Current design allows it to be detected and located
quite easily within a 50' radius of the radar system
being used to illuminate it. TAWDRYYARD draws
as 8 [Mt at 2.5V (20uW) allowing a standard lithium
coin cell to power it for months or years. The
simplicity of the design allows the form factor to
be tailored for speciﬁc operational requirements.
Future capabilities being considered are return of
GPS coordinates and a unique target identifier and

    

automatic processing to scan a target area for .... .
presence of TAWDRYYARDS. All components are

COTS and so are non-attributable to NSA. .
(U) Concept of Operation

(TS/ISIHREL T0 USA.FVEY) The board generates a square wave operating .
at a preset frequency. This square wave is used to turn a FET (ﬁeld effect

transistor) on and off. When the unit is illuminated with 8 CW signal. the .
illuminating signal is amplitude-modulated (AM) with the square wave. This
signal is re—radiated. where it is picked up by the radar. then processed to 

recover the clock signal. Typically. the fundamental is used to indicate the
unit's presence. and is simply displayed on a low frequency spectrum
analyzer. TAWDRYYARD is part of the ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of radar
retro-reﬂectors.

(T SIISIHREL) TOTEGHOSTLY 2.0 is a software implant for the Windows Mobile
operating system that utilizes modular mission applications to provide specific
SIGINT lunctionality. This functionality includes the ability to remotely pushlpull ﬁles
from the device. SMS retrieval. contact list retrieval. voicemail. geolocation. hot mic.
camera capture. cell tower location. etc. Command. control. and data exfiltration
can occur over SMS messaging or a GPRS data connection. A FRIEZERAMP
interface using HTTPSlinkZ transport module handles encrypted communications.

(TSIISUIREL) The initial release of TOTEGHOSTLY 2.0 will locus on installing the
implant via close access methods. A remote installation capability will be pursued
for a future release.

(T SIISIHREL) TOTEGHOSTLY 2.0 will be controlled using an interface tasked
through the NCC {Network Control Center) utilizing the XML based tasking and data
