Three-Feather Solution

GALLANTWAVE application

- Same module supports NetDef and SlGiNT

- Supports dynamic update of targeting via UTT
- Supports static target updates

GALLANTWAVE Reinjection application
- Same module supports NetDef and SlGiNT

_ Supports re-injection of decrypt into TURMOlL for detection by BLUESNORT

BLUESNORT in Stage 1 Prime application
, Emits events off decrypted, re-packetized, reinjected data

Status

- Running on MHS DEV ESO T5 and T22

- Transform, Reinjection, Signature Hits
confirmed

- Signatures need further development
to produce true hits vs. false positives

- NTOC POC reviewing XKS hits to
generate new signatures.

Issues/Risks

1. CA Servers at Net Defense Sites
5) iTx Connectivity to LONGHAUL

w NTOC requires stand-up of separate dev and live iTX fabric

i. - H/W funding may be needed
ii. - Need paperwork for update to firewall — submission expected by 25 Feb
a Expected completion was 29 Feb; now delayed to TBD

a) SSH connectivity

e; Short term: via BLUEBOX CA Servers at Pentagon - done

a Longer term: via deployment ofservers within the NTOC enclave that connect to CA Servers in the field

2. GALLANTWAVE Targeting Challenges
5) MAiLORDER/Ni-Fl not yet available

a) Mitigation: Manually load static targeting files

GW—Ta rg etM a n a g e r respo n d s to‘"'"iaa'a'ta"raa't'§"'ré'a'uést
from CoreSSC, pulls the GW IP addresses from the
Targeting database; issues control—flow messages
for each IP:Port combination and sends periodic
updates for those.

FCP responds to control—flow messages by
promoting all packets to/from the targeted IP:port
combinations, and PacketRouter ensures these
packets are sent to GW—FIP for sessionization. GW—
FIP outputs 'raw' SOTF session—fragments to the
TE—GW service on the same host.

GW-SessionFilter identifies sessions containing
target technology—of—interest by applying an
appropriate appld tag to each session—fragment.
GW—FragmentFilter removes session—fragments not
containing an appropriate appld for the target
technology—of—interest. Additionally, as a work—
around for an issue in FIP 3.1.10, erroneous
session—fragments missing a specific metadata
filed are removed. GW—MI applies SRI obtained
from Dfid Allocator.

EGWEMI applies SRI obtained from the DFID

allocator.
