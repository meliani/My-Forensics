U.S. Military Leaders Defended

- Based on information from SIGINT
collection, a TUTELAGE
countermeasure was developed and
deployed in 2009 for a particular
BYZANTINE HADES attack.

-On October 21st and 22ml 2010, the
spear-phishing attack was

_  __ launched. The attack targeted four

,-’Cﬂ‘:ountermeasurme'y users, including the Chairman of the

“-.-.??Ye'°??€  Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of
 '   Naval Operations, with a carefully

disguised malicious PDF.

- NTOC operated the countermeasure
and the attack was thwarted.
