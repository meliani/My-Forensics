communications products and applications, and
modus operandi are being used by terrorists,
terrorist groups, or in locations of interest?

(U) Does NSA CT know what emerging
technologies, communications products and
applications, and modus operandi are likely to be
used by terrorists, terrorist groups, or in locations

Risk Management for SIGINT

Threats (U)

(SI/REL) Threat to SIGINT Capability

— A behavior or technology that has the potential to have a negative
impact on NSA’s capability to provide SIGINT on a Terrorism Target

(U) Use Risk
— The possibility that a particular threat will be adopted by Terrorist targets
(SI/REL) Indications and Warning

— Early warning of high impact threats to prevent surprise to key
stakeholders and reduce risk from Terrorist adoption of technology that
would adversely affect SIGINT production

The data-driven approach

(U)

"Count what is countable, measure what is measurable, and make measurable that
which cannot be measured”

Galileo (1 7th century astronomer)

"When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers,
you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot
express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind"

Lord Kelvin (discovered absolute zero)

"YOu cannot manage what you cannot measure”
Bill Hewlett (co-founder of Hewlett-Packard)

"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted
counts"

- Albert Einstein

So... what i_s a (CT) trend?

(U)

A trend is a measurement of occurrence

(S//REL) Comparing the behavior of a single target...
— Pattern-of—life
— Modus Operandi
— Technology Usage

...to the behaviors seen within the target space

— Multiple targets, within and across the entire CT enterprise

— Over a period of time

Optic #1: Emerging Technology

Discovery (U)

- (S//Sl//REL) Emerging Technology & Behavior Discovery

— Detection of interest, experimentation, knowledge transfer or direction using
content, metrics approaches

— Currently using deskside & virtual engagement to leverage TOPI analyst
initiative to discover, prioritize, and work against "strongest" indicators

— Leverages inherent TOPI expertise and functions of traffic processing/translation/tasking
etc..

— Embedded analysts, virtual relationships: production “customers”
— Currently identifying, tracking 'technical’ thought leaders
— Technical sub-forums, scanning notes measurements

— Administrative emails (No-Reply etc..)
— Forum links, uploaded/downloaded files

Goal: Generate Prioritized Input (techs/behaviors) for Research

 

—
Optic #2: Technology Use

Discovery (U)

, (S//Sl//REL) Technology Use and Behavior Discovery

_ "Stratactical" data sets
_ Includes target-specific data point for each item (e.g. selector)

_ Discovery of target behavior by identifying technology use patterns, trends, and/or
anomalies in:

_ User-agents (browsers, OS, devices)

_ Tasking (new tasking, total tasking)

_ Network, Protocol usage (Active User metrics)

_ Visited URLs, web searches

_ Process lists, pre-fetch logs, registry entries, software logs

_ Hardware usage (smartphones, tablets, SD cards)

_ Currently using various tools (XKEYSCORE, SEEKER, BIONICTURTLE, JEMA, JOLLYROGER,
MARINA, TUNINGFORK, QFDs, etc...) and approaches with multiple cloud analytics in
varying stages of development and/or planning

Goal: Generate Prioritized Input (techs/behaviors) for Research _

Measurement Drives Research (U)

(S//REL) Triage begins with target indicators of a new technology

Derived from either optic: Emerging or Use Discovery

Interest, Experimentation, Use, Knowledge Transfer, Metric, etc...

Target =, Technology =, Do other targets use this technology?

This is the central d_efining question for Trends Analysis:
Do other CT targets use this technology?

The Wicked Problem Aspect (U)

(S//REL) Defining the problem is the first (wicked)
problem

Triage Stage 1
Initial priority: (single) target + initial understanding of technology
Implications Research

What does the product/service do?
Current NSA capabilities to detect, collect, exploit, analyze?
Do any other CT targets use it?

Triage Stage 2
Updated priority: target(s) + updated understanding of tech/USSS

Validated Next Steps

As needed: capabilities/access development requirements

Reporting: internal, CIR, e-gram; Gaps report; prioritization w/in tech category

Goal: Periodic Reporting

Vehicle (U)

. (U//FOUO) Move beyond ad hoc task responses to routine deliverables

. (U//FOUO) Overcoming volume challenge
_ Huge variety of inputs, massive numbers in each
_ Prioritization
_ Visualization

. (SI/REL) Moving threats to a simple Risk Assessment model
_ Borrows methodology from models used for executive purposes elsewhere in agency
_ (FAMT, Geopolitical Technology Trends Matrix, TAO...)
_ Opportunities, threats handled separately

Capability Development

Challenges (U)

(TS/ISl/IREL) With rare exceptions,
application-specific solutions are only
built based on these two criteria????

. In resource-restrained environment, development of capabilities against likely-
to-increase in priority applications is trumped by standing requirements
driven by known priority applications

. Capabilities development response to current/priority technology threats occurs
normally w/in existing resources — but response does not scale, either to the
industry or to multiple crises

V' I. t. (U)

(TS//S|//REL) Excel tops out at a million rows...

— 19 branches, 30+ target sets, ~200 realms, ~800 domains, ~45000
selectors = 1 million rows/~25 weeks for summarized active user events
from E012333 alone

— Spreadsheets are good, but not everyone knows how to use a
pivot table

— Each dataset can easily provide 4-5 or more pivoted looks for
each branch/target set = minimum 100-150 slides

  

multiple large datasets on a monthly
basis for collection management,

    
 

 

 

TOP SECRET//COMINT//REL FVEY//20340601

—
Visualization (U)

(SI/REL) Analysts work at the selector level

Leadership wants data presented at the target level

(SI/REL) Automated population of technology, behavior
information in analyst workflow tools, databases

(S//REL) Each separate visualization task takes
manpower, time away from operational analysis

 

—
Clean Data (U)

(S/lSI/IREL) Metrics will only provide a near-accurate picture: ground truth will always be the domain of
the TOPI and based on content

(S/lSI/IREL) Some selectors (accurately) map to multiple targets, multiple teams, multiple organizations
(S/lSI/IREL) Some selectors simply don't have a known target, only a target set

(SI/REL) Need to correlate across widely different datasets requires creation of normalized bridge
datasets (e.g. comparing executables to domains)

(S/lSI/IREL) TKB/U'I'I' are victims of years of “fill in the blank" freeform data entry; very slowly being
addressed (~2015?)

Rising Strategic Issues (U)

- (TS//S|//REL) Encrypted Webmail Services
— Atabmail, Zoho, Safe-mail, Fastmail, HMA Mail

- (TS//S|//REL) Remote Desktop Viewers/Remote Access Tools

— TeamViewer, Join.me, Cybergate

- (TS//S|//REL) Aggregators/Over—the-Top Messaging Services
— WhatsApp, Nimbuzz, eBuddy

 

What Next? (U)

(S/lSl/IREL) Continue to build, strengthen, expand:
_ internal workflows, research and discovery capabilities

_ collaboration with production elements

_ Operational support via embedded analysts at NSAW
_ Tradecraft, technical support virtually with extended enterprise

_ partnerships with FVEY SIGDEV community

_ Establish and expand dialogue opportunities
_ "Failure Sharing" — tradecraft sharing and operational deconfliction
