' We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor
users all the time.

- With manual analysis we can de-anonymize a
very small fraction of Tor users, however, no
success de-anonymizing a user in response to a
TOPI request/on demand.

A - ( ‘ zTor entry node 1,», Tor exit node —\j_

Current: access to m few nodes. Success rate negligible
because all three Tor nodes in the circuit have to be in the set
of nodes we have access to.

— Difﬁcult to combine meaningfully with passive SIGINT.

Goal: expand number of nodes we have access to
— GCHQ runs Tor nodes under NEWTONS CRADLE (how many?)

— Other partners?
— Partial reconstruction (ﬁrst hops or last hops)?

 

Analytics:

Goes lnta Goes Outta/Low Latenc 
Find possible alternative accounts for a target: ook

for connections to Tor, from the target’ 5
suspected country, near time of target’ 5 activity.

Current: GCHQ has working version (QUICKANT). R has
alpha tested NSA’ 5 version. NSA’ 5 version produced no
obvious candidate selectors.

° Goal: Figure out if QUICKANT works, compare

methodologies. Gathering data for additional tests of
NSA’ 5 version (consistent, random and heavy user)

 

Analytics: Cookie Leakage

Use cookies to identify Tor users when they are
not using Tor
Current: preliminary analysis shows that some cookies

“survive” Tor use. Depends on how target is using Tor
(Torbutton/Tor Browser Bundle clears out cookies).

Goal: test with cookies associated with CT targets
— Idea: what if we seeded cookies to a target?

 

— Investigate Evercookie persistence

 

Analytics: Cookie Leakage

- Doubleclicle seen on Tor and non-Tor IPs

 

Analytics: Dumb Users (EPICFAIL) 

GCHQ QFD that looks for Tor users when they
are not using Tor.

- Current: GCHQ has working QFD based on
hard selector (email, web forum, etc) but does
not include cookies.

- Goal: NSA investigating own version (GREAT
EXPECTATIONS) that would include cookies.

 

Analytics: Node Lifespan 

How do I know WHEN a particular IP was a Tor
node as opposed to IF it was a Tor node?

' Current: detection done once an hour by NTOC.
RONIN stores “last seen” and nodes age off
slowly with no accurate lifespan.

- Goal: Working with RONIN to add more details
on node lifespan.

 

Analytics: DNS 

How does Tor handle DNS requests? Are DNS
requests going through Tor? Does this depend
on how the target is using Tor?

' Current: Still investigating.

 

Technical Analysis: Hidden Services

(TS//Sl)

What do we know about Hidden Services?

' Current: No effort by NSA, some DSD and
GCHQ work on ONIONBREATH.

' Goal:
— Harvest and enumerate .onion URLs

— Identify similar HS based on referrer ﬁelds
— Distinguish HS from normal Tor clients

 

Technical Analysis: Timing Pattern

(TS//S|)

Send packets back to the client that are
detectable by passive accesses to ﬁnd client
IPs for Tor users.

' Current: GCHQ has research paper and
demonstrated capability in the lab.

' Goal: Can we expand to other owned nodes?

 

Technical Analysis: torservers.net 

SI}

Investigate the Amazon AWS cloud instances of
Tor servers. How are IPs allocated and
reassigned once bandwidth limit is reached?
Impact on RONIN’ s ability to detect nodes?

- Current: GCHQ set up Tor nodes on the AWS
cloud during REMATION ||.

 

Exploitation: QUANTUM 

° QUANTUM to degrade/deny/disrupt Tor access?

° QUANTUMCOOKIE — forces clients to divulge
stored cookies.

Exploitation: Existing Options

Test current CNE techniques (FA and SHORTSHEET)
against Torbutton and T88 users.

° Current: Torbutton and T88 prevent CNE success.
Possible success against “vanilla” Tor/Vidalia.

' Goal: modiﬁcations to initial CNE surveys? Ignore
user-agents from Torbutton or TBB? Improve
browser ﬁngerprinting? Using javascript instead
of Flash?

 

Exploitation: Shaping

Given CNE access to a target computer can we
shape their trafﬁc to “friendly” exit nodes?

Route users to a separate “private” Tor network?
Stain their trafﬁc or user agent?

Instruct target computer to use a service that
connects outside Tor and reveal true IP?

Current: Can stain user agent working on shaping.

 

Exploitation: Web Server Enabling

(TS//S|)

Given CNE access to web server modify the server

to enable a “timing/counting” attack similar to
timing pattern idea.

' Current: GCHQ has a research paper and
demonstrated the technique in the lab.

 

Exploitation: Nodes

Can we exploit nodes?
Probably not. Legal and technical challenges.

 

Exploitation: Degrade Tor experience

(TS//S|)

Given CNE access to a web server make it
painful for Tor users?

Given CNE access to a network can we deny/
degrade/disrupt Tor users’ ?

 

Nodes: Baseline Our Nodes

How many nodes do we have cooperative or
direct access to? Can we deploy similar code
to these nodes to aid with circuit

reconstruction?
Can we do packet timing attacks using nodes?
Can we use the nodes to shape trafﬁc ﬂow?

Can we use the nodes to deny/degrade/disrupt
comms to certain sites?

 

Nodes: Tor Node Flooding

Could we set up a lot of really slow Tor nodes
(advertised as high bandwidth) to degrade the
overall stability of the network?

 

Tor Stinks... But it Could be Worse

lS//S|)

' Critical mass of targets use Tor. Scaring them
away from Tor might be counterproductive.

- We can increase our success rate and provide
more client lPs for individual Tor users.

- Will never get 100% but we don’ t need to

provide true lPs for every target every time
they use Tor.
