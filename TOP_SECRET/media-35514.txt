Need

§ Peer to forward “ ‘missing’ attack-events to LONGHAUL”, to LONGHAUL, so
LONGHAUL can use them to complete single-sided processing.

§ LONGHAUL to reciprocate.
Approach

§ LONGHAUL to become aware of which ‘Events’ are not pairing local to agency
and to request peer to send (copy) of such events to LONGHAUL

§ Minimise bandwidth required to communicate requests
§ Peering is a back-end (KPS <-> LONGHAUL)

§ Peers process independently

 

Single-sided A->B using peering

  
    

 

event[B->A]

 

event[B->A]

Filtered pairing

 

event[B->A]
event[E-> F]

event[A-> B]
event[C->|2]
