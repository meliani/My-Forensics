Alerting and Characterization of

SECRET/[REL TO USA, FVEY MISSION

(SI/REL) High Level Goals

0 Detect (all!) botnet activity on our sensors

- Alert only when activity is relevant and time-sensitive

» Involves entities/commanding of high interest
» Involves protected areas
» Could initiate defensive action

- Generate metadata always
» Aids in attribution and retrospective analysis

- Enrich metadata as much as possible
» Alleviate the need for in-depth knowledge of actors or malware

(SI/REL) What we offer today

0 An extensible botnet processing service
- Capabilities are added via configuration or specialized processors

0 The ability to track events spanning across 5-tuples

- Enables production of Event Summaries and Enrichment
9 Geographical dispersion

- SIGINT perspective, currently at SCS sites and MHS (prototype)
O TURMOIL augments Defensive Efforts two fold

- Early warning Tips for defensive action (to NETEZZA, then
TUTELAGE)

- Metadata for characterization and to support attribution (to
GMPLACE and RONIN, then CYBERCLOUD and MARINA).

(SI/REL) Progress over the last year

0 Advancements

- Zeus RC4 encrypted processing flow
- Base64 decoding e.g. BEB v1.8 target IP extraction

- Limited Metadata Enrichment
» Case Study to support QBOT activities
- Deployment to F6 sites and a second system at MHS

- Established ASDF to GMPLACE for GHOSTMACHINE analytics
- Established flow to NETEZZA (TURQI) for validation

- Defined Botnet Lifecycle Model for categorizing enrichment
metadata

 

SECRET/[REL TO USA, FVEY MISSION

(S/lREL) Current Development Focus

0 Attain analyst validation
- Ingest into GM and creating Views
- End-to-end dataflow validation

0 Improve Metadata Enrichment capabilities
- Define generic model to create metadata PCRE rules
- Refine Enrichment Model for Malware

O Improvements to function as a framework/service
- Greater focus on metadata enrichment

0 Provide dynamic AEG tasking

O Re-factor Tasking and Tips to fit botnets
- Update Tip format to closely align with extracted data
0 Add specialized packet processors

- Mariposa
- Looking for opportunities

 

SECRET/[REL TO USA, FVEY MISSION

(SI/REL) Future Work

0 Initial development
- Initiate promotion (to XKS) or collection flows
- Re-factor SEG to make Metadata Enrichment more flexible

- Redesign the Analytic to provide more valuable Summaries
» Possibly detect point of origin of Herder commanding

0 Biggest Challenges

- Currently have no means to track peer-to-peer botnet activity

» May look to current TURMOIL Fast Flux capabilities for ideas
- Encrypted bots defeat most attempts at tracking and reporting

» Possible candidate for TU RMOIL Re-lnjection flow

(TS/ISl/IREL) The Components

0 BotDiscoveryAeg
- Not A Snort based Application.
- Ingests translated Snort signatures and tasks the FSPF.
- Emulates Snort behavior as closely as possible.
0 RC4Aeg/RC4Seg
- Highly specialized components aimed at detecting RC4 Encrypted Zeus activity
0 MariposaAeg (Currently in development)
- Highly specialized — detects and decodes a particular encoding.
Q BotDiscoverySeg
- De-dups on SID/5 Tuple for Tipping and MARINA.
- De-dups on SID/IP/Port for BotAnalyticSeg.
O BotAnaIyticSeg
- Summarizes Event Metadata from BotDiscoverySeg.
- Provides metadata to RONIN.
O CIDR Block/SID Filter
- Filters Tip Events based on IP information OR SID.
O cbiot
- Translates Tip messages to adhere to TRAFFICTHIEF schemas.

(SI/REL) “Categorizing” Existing Signatures

  
 

9‘ Most popular bot signature analyst repositories:
- BLUESMOKE: Snort Rules
- XKEYSCORE: Fingerprints

 

o Requires author to add extra detail to the existing
signature

0 Requires front end tools to add extra fields to their
GUls for analyst input

- Suggested that the Lifecycle Stage Group and Stage
Instance be required for submission for botnet signatures

- Other attributes may be optional for submission
