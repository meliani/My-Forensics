(Ul/FOUO) LONGHAUL Overview
(U) General

(U) DataFlow and CONOP

(TS/ISI/IREL) The LONGHAUL system is composed of several components as shown in this
End-to-End View. LONGHAUL receives cryptanalytic information (CA Data) from the ﬁeld systems
and passes information back to ﬁeld systems using its Front End. The Front End validates the
sender/receiver using CASPORT services. LONGHAUL contains Attack Orchestration
components (one orchestrator for each distinct type of attack), and Attack Service components.
Attack orchestration ﬁgures out what cryptanalytic processing should be applied for each piece of
CA Data, and then initiates, and as needed manages, that processing. Attack service performs the
cryptanalytic attack. Once the processing is complete, the result is returned to the attack
orchestration component, information about the processing is "saved" for Management and
Analysis, and then as appropriate the result is returned to the "requesting" CA Server.
LONGHAUL accesses CES Databases for certain information needed for attack orchestration and
attack services. LONGHAUL also provides an interface for CES Analysts that need access to
information pertaining to the LONGHAUL processed data. LONGHAUL maintains its own internal
databases for the management and control of its processing activities.

LONGHAUL End-to-End Overview

(TS/ISI/IREL) LONGHAUL (in Purge_Surge parlance) is a Collection Store, that is a "system that
processes and/or retains collected SIGINT data items, and that permits access to those
performing collection functions and limits access of those performing intelligence analysis".
LONGHAUL maintains internal databases that contain Cryptanalytic "technical data", and
LONGHAUL also exchanges Cryptanalytic "technical data" with other CES databases and with
CES HPC resources that perform cryptanalytic attacks. This "technical data" includes recovered

20f15

LONGHAUL - WikiInfO

keys, information about what crypt processing is appropriate, data needed for cryptanalytic
attacks, as well as information retained to enable future cryptanalytic attacks. LONGHAUL does
not store cipher data or ever have access to decrypted data. If the "technical datall passed to
Attack Service components or CES databases contains information from the collected stream (as
opposed to information about the collected stream such as SIGAD, DTOI), then appropriate
Critical Identifying Information (CII) will be passed also. From a compliance perspective this is
the system being "certiﬁed".

(TS/lSI/IREL) Field deployed collection systems and CA Servers (also known as Extended
LONGHAUL) are shown on the left. A CA Server is the ﬁeld CES component that runs CA
Services. The terms CA Server or CA Services are used depending on the context
(hardware/software). For information on CA Server deployments see the CES/DNCA wiki pages
CA Servers (— , and for information on CA Server
architecture see LONGHAUL/CA Server. The CA Server stores cipher data, and decrypts it based
upon a key returned by LONGHAUL.

(S/lSI/IREL) LONGHAUL is a High Availability system using hardware at two geographically
distributed locations to also provide a COOP capability. LONGHAUL uses the Application
Messaging Framework AMF with the ISLANDTRANSPORT (ITX) transport and
ISLANDHIDEAWAY (IH) integrity and privacy capabilities to send data between collection
systems and LONGHAUL. The requestor of CA Services (the ﬁeld deployed CA Server) never
knows (or needs to know) which hardware is used to process its requests. LONGHAUL and the
AMF manage the physical routing and failover behavior of the system.

(TS/lSI/IREL) LONGHAUL has a Service-Oriented, Java-Based Enterprise Architecture. It includes
multiple coordinated software development efforts. Each Attack Orchestrator is a major
development effort, as are the Management and Analysis and Security and Policy
components. LONGHAUL also has a hardware acquisition component, and manages the
interfaces and integration activities with TURMOIL/TURBULENCE (collection), and the High
Performance Computing (HPC) activities of CES/T5. The LONGHAUL team is responsible for all
phases of development, starting with requirements, thorough design, technology selection,
development, integration, system test, and deployment. The team is also responsible for the
system engineering and hardware design and acquisition to support a two-site, high-availability
system.

(Cl/SI/IREL) In July 201 0, T1, T5 and CES signed an SLA _)~ for llthe provisioning and support of
Cryptanalytic (CA) Services within the TURBULENCE Passive Collection Suite (TU PCS)."

(Ul/FOUO) POISONNUT

(TS/ISI/IREL) POISONNUT (—) is a Child LONGHAUL
Project that enables Data Network Cipher (DNC) Recovery. Initial Customer Capability was
released on September 30, 2009. LONGHAUL/POISONNUT (DNC) was determined by CES and
T5 SPO to be IOC on 10 Jan. 2011.

(Ul/FOUO) SCARLETFEVER

(TS/ISIIIREL) SCARLETFEVER (_ is a Child
LONGHAUL Project that enables Data Network Session Cipher (DNSC) Recovery. Initial

Customer Capability was achieved in December 2010.

(U) Management and Analysis

(U) For this very high level view our diagram shows Management and Analysis as one block.
This block contains many components and further details can be found on the Software
Architecture page.

(U) Additionally, LONGHAUL has begun to create a set of web applications for Management

(U) Security and Policy

(U/IFOUO) SPAM is our Security, Policy, and Adjudication Module which will be used to apply
rules for sanitizing, ﬁltering, and determining if a response should be sent to a particular client.

(U) Common

(S/lSI/IREL) All child projects share LONGHAUL COMMON components or services. This is not
shown as a separate block on the diagram as all the components use COMMON.

(U) Interfaces (ICD)

(U) All Interfaces are described on the ICD wiki page. These include both the external interfaces
(how a CA Server communicates with LONGHAUL) as well as the interfaces LONGHAUL uses
with other CES systems.

(U) Design
(U) Architecture

(U/IFOUO) Software and Hardware architecture discussions are available on the LONGHAUL
Architecture page.

(U) High Availability

(S/lSI/IREL) LONGHAUL is a high availability system that makes use of Continuity of Operations
(COOP) to meet availability requirements. The system is designed from both hardware and
software perspectives to provide high availability, ensuring that key recovery services are always
available. The two site deployment with equal processing capacity will meet the COOP
requirement for the system. Each system is designed with redundant hardware and processes so
that the system can survive any single component (hardware or software) failure. During normal
operation, both systems will be operational and share the processing load. In the event of a single
site failure, the second site will, within seconds, assume total processing responsibility, but at
reduced capacity. The requestor of CA Services (the ﬁeld deployed CA Server) never knows (or
needs to know) which hardware is used to process its requests. CA Servers send data to
LONGHAUL and receive responses from LONGHAUL using the AMF. LONGHAUL and the AMP
manage the physical routing and failover behavior of the system.

(U/IFOUO) For more detailed information, see Availability Analysis.
(U) AMF/ITx JMS Messaging

(U/IFOUO) The use of a high capacity, low latency JMS messaging fabric is critical to the success
of the LONGHAUL mission. LONGHAUL has worked closely with the Application Messaging
Framework (AMF) team to design a fabric to support the LONGHAUL requirements.

(U) See AMF / LONGHAUL Teaming for more detailed information.

(U/IFOUO) The collection site clients (CA Servers) will publish messages into the fabric with no
knowledge of where the processing actually occurs. The fabric should support both active/active
and active/passive processing modes. In active/active mode multiple sites would consume the
same message, and manage the client response strategy. In active/passive, one site would
consume a message, but in a failure mode, an alternate site would seamlessly pick up message

consumption.
(U) Deployment
(U) Hardware

(U/IFOUO) LONGHAUL is composed of almost identical hardware at two geographically
distributed sites - the Tordella Supercomputer Building (TSCB) at Fort Meade and Oak Ridge
Data Center (ORDC) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The initial hardware conﬁgurations for TSCB and
ORDC arrived in November 2009 and May 2010 respectively. The ﬁnal conﬁgurations arrived in
Jan 201 1 at both sites. A system, termed "Hadoop ClusterII has also been purchased to produce
analytics and store metrics for LONGHAUL. The Hadoop Cluster will reside at ORDC and is
scheduled to be delivered in April 201 1. CAVIUM is being considered for CA Server.

(U) Tier 2 Support

(U/IFOUO) Tier 2 Support is provided by Maintenance/Operations Support (LONGHAUL team).
Maintenance/Operations Support provides the day-to-day administration and support of
production systems in accordance with documented, deployed conﬁgurations. Doing so usually
requires speciﬁc knowledge about the associated servers, applications and how they interact.
With respect to applications, this is referred to as "applications administration", as opposed to
"systems administrationll which is performed at the server hardware and operation systems (OS)
level. Tier 2 also serves as the escalation point for problems not resolved at the Tier 1 level.
Problems related to the internal workings of the software or are integration-related issues are
escalated to the appropriate Tier 3 organization for resolution. Use the "Tier 2 Support" link
