TOP SECRET STRAPl

BULLRUN

- Covers the ability to defeat encryption used in
specific network communications

- Includes multiple, extremely sensitive, sources
and methods

PTD “We penetrate targets' defences.”

Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security
(SSL/TLS) (webmail)

Secure Shell (SSH)

Encrypted chat

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
Encrypted VolP

Response to improving security

- For the past decade, NSA has lead an
aggressive, multi-pronged effort to break widely
used Internet encryption technologies

° Cryptanalytic capabilities are now coming on line

- Vast amounts of encrypted Internet data which
have up till now been discarded are now
exploitable

- Major new processing systems, SIGDEV efforts
and tasking must be put in place to capitalize on
this opportunity

Sensitivities
- Cryptanalytic capabilities

— Are extremely difficult and costly to acquire
— Require a long lead time

— Depend on sensitive sources

— Are very fragile

— If lost, may never be regained

° The mere “fact of” a capability is very sensitive:

— An adversary who knows what we can/cannot break is
able to elude our capabilities even without knowing the
technical details of how the capabilities work

PTD “We penetrate targets' defences.”

 

TOP SECRET STRAPl

Protecting BULLRUN Capabilities

- Technical and operational details

— Need to be known only by cryptanalysts and those who
enable cryptanalysis

— Protected by established ECl’s
- PICARESQUE , PAWLEYS, AMBULANT, 

“Fact of” information

— Needs to be known very widely within the SIGINT
production chain

— Protect with new secure community of interest (COI)

PTD “We penetrate targets' defences.”

 

TOP SECRET STRAPl
Protecting the Info — Secure COI

- Secure Community of Interest (COI) — protects
“fact of” as well as volume and scope of the
capability

- BULLRUN indoctrination required for access to
COI

- BULLRUN-related material, data — decrypted
content and decrypted metadata, and details must
be protected within the COI

PTD “We penetrate targets' defences.”

 

TOP SECRET STRAPl
Protecting the information

- BULLRUN is for internal (Sigint) use only

- Implemented at NSA &CSEC; DSD & GCSB to
follow

- Not to be shared with UK Partners / customers

- EP not to reveal sources & methods; further
guidance to be developed

- BULLRUN brief on Gcwiki for reference

PTD “We penetrate targets' defences.”

Examples

° (8 81) Unspecified capabilities against [VPNs, IPSEC,
TLS/SSL, HTTPS, SSH, PPTP, eChat, eVoIP]

' (T8 81 COMINT) Capabilities against the encryption used in
[VPNs, IPSEC, TLS/SSL, HTTPS, SSH, PPTP, eChat, eVoIP]

0 (T8 82 BULLRUN) Capability against specific applications

PTD “We penetrate targets' defences.”

 

TOP SECRET STRAPl

BULLRUN Bottom Line

° Groundbreaking capabilities

- Extremely fragile

- Do not ask about or speculate on sources or methods
underpinning BULLRUN successes

- Indoctrination required for access to secure COI
