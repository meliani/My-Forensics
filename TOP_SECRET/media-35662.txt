iPhone target analysis and exploitation with unique
device identifiers

  

Summary

This paper describes standard analysis techniques
that have been used to both discover iPhone
target end point machines and implant target
iPhones directly using the QUANTUM system. It
shows that the iPhone Unique Device Identifier
(UDID) can be used for target tracking and can be
used to correlate with end point machines and
target phone. It highlights the exploits currently
available and the ONE process to enable further
targeting.

B. BACKGROUND

1. Every Apple iPhone, iPad and iPod touch has a unique hardware
identifier called the Apple UDID. The UDID is a 40 character hex string
(160 bits) that seems to be a SHA-l hash of the IMEI, serial number and
the Bluetooth and WiFi MAC addresses. The UDID is available to
developers of applications for these devices. and it is used to identify a
given device. As highlighted in [a]. the UDID is seen in multiple apps and
can be used to allow target tracking or be used to correlate with other
personal identifiers.

2. The Mobile Theme has invested a large amount of research into iPhone
apps and metadata anal sis over the last year accumulating with a
detailed report done by [c] in October 2009 and 29 SEM rules
created by lCTR-MCT [b]. These rules have used to extract iPhone
metadata for a number of apps and in particular the Unique Device
Identifier (UDID) from any carrier being processed using DEBIT CARDs.
Further TDI rules are being developed by GTE that will in the future
extract UDID events from carriers processed through the MVR system.
The resulting events have then been used to populate both research and
corporate QFDs (Query Focused Datasets) such as MUTANT BROTH
and AUTOASSOC and will eventually form the basis of mobile
correlations in HARD ASSOC.

3. Initially, an exploit was developed by the Joint CNE/TECA Mobile
Exploitation Team for iPhone that was to be delivered to the target
phone when syncing with an exploited end point machine. This was
successful for a BROKER target and resulted in the extraction of SMS,
call logs and contact details. After this initial trial, ONE and SD undertook
work to discover other single end points seen syncing with iPhones.

4. At HANDEX 2010 (handset exploitation workshop) in August, various
aspects of the iPhone 08 were investigated for potential vulnerabilities.

Using an open source PDF vulnerability when using the Safari browser,
Joint CNEITECA Mobile Exploitation Team were able to develop an
exploit to deliver a WARRIORPRIDE implant to a target test phone.
Further. investigation. liaison and testing with the CNE QUANTUM team
resulted in approval for the implant to be deployed against QUANTUM
iPhone targets.

DESCRIPTION OF ANALYSIS

CNE Endpoint

TD 1‘

As part of the SD Mobile Exploitation theme to identify further end point
machines that had been seen syncing with iPhones. a survey was
undertaken by CNE and TAO to scan all target end point machines for
the appropriate iPhone registry keys. Scanning of all CNE stored single
end point (SEPs) registry keys on particular process IDs resulted in 9
CNE endpoints seen this year sync’d with iPhones. The resulting Unique
Device Identifiers (UDID) were extracted from the registry keys and ran
in MUTANT BROTH and AUTOASSOC, resulting in 6 correlations with
either iPhone Safari user agents or the iPhone Mail app seen in passive
collection.

A CNE end point operation against—(ABSOLINE

EPILSON had resulted in access to a windows end point machine
. A scan of this machine's re istr keys resulted in UDID
. As can be seen, the

UDID has been seen with the Admob SEM rule type and with the Apple-
lMEl-URI TDI type. Admob is the largest mobile advertising network
allowing games publishers to embed adverts and therefore receive
revenue from a number of different brands. The target iPhone OS is 3_0
as shown in the User Agent profile in figure 2.

the Checking BROADOAK tasking revealed that both targets
had known associated iPhone lMEls already tasked.

A recent rescan of all currently active CNE SEPs resulted in only 5 of the
9 identified CNE machines actually being available for exploit. The other
4 implants having been removed. Of these five UDle, four returned with
correlated UDle that had recently been seen in passive collection.
These are contained in the iPhone target list [f].

Analysis of all TAO SEPs resulted in 116 UDle being identified. Of
these UDle, 15 were correlated with iPhone user agents and the
resulting identifier type. project name, case notation and IP noted. A full
list is available in the iPhone target list [f]. Of these four had the Cydia

QUANTUM EXPLOIT

After extensive testing of the QUANTUM tipping and redirection to the
SHORTSHEET exploitation server by the Joint CNE/TECA Mobile
Exploitation Team. further target development work was needed to
identify iPhone targets recently seen active on the appropriate user
agents. Bulk extraction of targets over a three-week period from
BLACKHOLE by ICTR resulted in a large number of iPhone targets and
further queries in Xkeyscore resulted in others. Others were passed from
discussions with various lPTs and two were also passed from TAO
contacts.

In total 44 selectors were checked to verify that the correct user agent
was present. Of these 44 selectors, 41 were yahoo selectors and 3 gmail
selectors. Of these 26 were seen with a valid iPhone Safari user agent
as shown in Figure 8. A summary of 08 versions seen with target
phones is shown in Table 1 with OS highlighted in red currently
exploited. These are 3_1_2, 3_1_3 and 4_0_1. In all 26 cases, the target
analysts were contacted with details regarding their targets use of an
exploitable iPhone.

case notations GWUKGOOS, GWVCB003 and IRUKCOB6. The resulting
information was then forwarded to the analysts in the-team for
tasking by the standard CNE process as outlined in the Good
Penetration Guide [d].

Figure 8 —Valid iPhone Safari user agent in MB (-<yahoo>)

The target — with target selector

was seen active on different iPhone OS
and more recently on an iPad. Three other targets were seen active on
iPads and two others on iPods but with no other associated iPhone
device. Of the 44 targets seen, 16 were seen using the iPhone Mail
client that comes by default with all 08. A total of 7 targets were seen
using the Yahoo Mobile Messenger app.

For all target selectors seen with valid Safari user-agents, further
MUTANT BROTH, AUTOASSOC and MARINA queries were performed
to discover any other possible 08 versions seen with the selector.
MARINA profile queries were performed resulting in the OS version
being returned within the MachinelD field. The resulting user-agents,
time/date, bearer, IP and any other associated selectors are shown in
the iPhone target list [f]. Associated selectors are either from MUTANT
BROTH, AUTOASSOC or seen directly as stated in BROADOAK. All
Yahoo B-cookies as shown in Figure 8 were run in MUTANT BROTH to
confirm their uniqueness with the iPhone and target yahoo selectors.

OPERATIONAL OUTCOME

The QUANTUM redirect and PDF Safari browser exploit was developed
to work against 3_1_2, 3_l_3 and 4_0_1 Safari 08 versions. Of the 26
targets seen with valid exploitable OS version, 5 were added to the
QUANTUM system for targetting.

Once notified, GCHQ IPTs either added the target to existing CNE
section 7 warrants as defined in [e] or developed targetting aids as
defined in [d] and wrote the appropriate warrant. The resulting section 7
warrants were approved by IPT team leaders and signed off by the CNE
Legal Team. Three NSA targets were discovered and were added by
CNE Legal Team to the Partner Agreement Forms to allow exploitation.

- and after further analysis it was discovered that this selector was
not-but an associate. It was removed from tasking.

Target analysis and warrant was completed for a further five targets and
a successful QUANTUM redirect and the PDF exploit was delivered for
—(URN PFVT658) on the 30th of October. The resulting
WARRIORPRIDE install was also performed and beaconed on the 2nd of
November. The target phone was shown to be jailbroken and on the 3rd
of November content was successfully extracted from the phone and
was available in Looking Glass. This is highlighted in Appendix B with
the resulting iPhone directory structure presented how it appears in
Looking Glass. The WARRIORPRIDE exploit has resulted in extraction
of the target's address book. sms. call logs, notes, WLAN logs.
bookmarks. map query history, Safari browsing history and some
images. Detailed analysis of extracted files will be covered in a further
report.

A successful redirect to in October was
performed but due to what is believed to be Javascript being disabled on
the phone the firmware type of the phone could not be confirmed to
enable the first stage implant. This initial survey of the firmware type has
now been removed after discussions within CNE but the target has not
been seen recently on his iPhone for exploitation. The two other targets
tasked for QUANTUM have failed to be seen recently in collect.

Currently, there are four CNE Single End Point machines that have been
identified with recently sync‘d iPhone targets. The most recent being an
OVERLIT target seen on 29/09/10. These targets are being monitored
by ONE and will have the SLIDE exploit installed to allow implant of
WARRIORPRIDE when the iPhone is sync'd with the existing SEP
machine.

CONCLUSION

With the analysis of the UDle on target machines and correlation in
passive collection with known target yahoo selectors, the UDID can be
used to correlate iPhone handset to end point sync machine and tasked
yahoo selectors. The UDID can be used for realtime tracking of target
iPhones and could in theory be used as a selector for QUANTUM events
where other traditional selectors (yahoo-Y/B cookie etc) are not present.
Of course an exploit for the application would have to be written which is
not trivial.

It is not possible at this time to take the UDID and reverse engineer the
SHA-l HASH to discover the lMEl, MAC addresses and serial number.

Further work is ongoing to identify targets of interest that are suitable for
the QUANTUM exploitation. Development and monitoring of current

identified tar ets is still being done. Discovery of an associated lMEl for
i will help in firmware identification and exploitation of this
target.

CNE are now conducting monthly surveys of all target machines registry
keys for iPhone UDle. A similar tipping mechanism for all BROADOAK
hits needs to be completed using a XKS workflow. Hopefully, other
targets will be added for QUANTUM exploitation or discovered on new
CNE SEPs in the future and a successful exploit of a target phone
performed.

FURTHER WORK

Analysis of three PRESTON accesses has resulted in the identification
of a number of iPhone targets. Development work against at least three
target sets is needed with extraction of appropriate UDle and iTunes
XDSID values. Suitable section 5 warrants need to be in place to pursue
these end point machines, once CNE have gained access and the
resulting target iPhones have been discovered.

With further work being undertaken by 888 and TECA on the
WHIPSAW redirect and exploitation server, it should be possible in the
coming months to implant directly the target iPhone. However, the
WHIPSAW exploit is only available via the tasked ADSL line.

An automatic implantation of SLIDE on to an iPhone is needed.
Currently this is manual process requiring a CNE operator to be
connected to the endpoint machine whilst the target is syncing the end
point machine and iPhone.

A larger number of iPhone TDls need to be written to allow further
events to be populated into the QFDs allowing correlations with other
target selectors. This will also enable further real-time tracking of target
identifiers.
