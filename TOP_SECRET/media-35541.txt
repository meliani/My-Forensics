Instead we are now

considering an entry—exit correlation attack. Data collected from
ICTR—NE/JTRIG infrastructure showed that some timing structure is
preserved between entry and exit node.

The successful outcome of this entry—exit correlation attack is documented in

GPO—Mg I ECH.B[61. An R package implementing the attack is available: E,
m.

The work was presented at SANAR11. The slides are here.

We plan to prototype the technique in the REMATION II workshop. The
introductory slides are here.
