(TSI/SI/INF) On Thursday, 11/5/09, the SSO—OAKSTAR
SILVERZEPHYR (SZ) access began forwarding FAA DNI records
to NSAW via the FAA WealthyCluster2/Tellurian system
installed at the partner's site. 550 coordinated with the
Data Flow Office and forwarded numerous sample files to a
test partition for validation. which was completely
successful. $50 will continue to monitor the flow and
collection to ensure a ny anomalies are identified and
corrected as required. SILVERZEPHYR will continue to
provide customers with authorized, transit DNR collection.
550 is working with the partner to gain access to an
additional 806bs of DNI data on their peering network,
bundled in 10 Gbs increments. The OAKSTAR team, along with
support from NSAT and GNDA, just completed a 12 day SIGINT
survey at site, which identified over 200 new links. During
the survey, GNDA worked with the partner to test the output
of their ACS system. OAKSTAR is also working with NSAT to
examine snapshots taken by the partner in Brazil and
Colombia, both of which may contain internal communications
for those countries.

(TS/lSI/INF) PRISM {US—984XN) expanded its impact on NSA’s reporting
mission in FY12 through increased tasking, collection and operational
improvements. Here are some highlights of the FY12 PRISM program:

PRISM is the most cited collection source in NSA lst Party end—product
reporting. More NSA product reports were based on PRISM than on any other
single SIGAD for all of NSA's lst Party reporting during FY12: cited in
15.1% of all reports (up from 14% in FY11). PRISM was cited in 13.4% of all
lst, 2nd' and 3rd Party NSA reporting (up from 11.9% in FY11), and is also
the top cited SIGAD overall

Number of PRISM—based end—product reports issued in FY12: 24,096, up
27% from FY11

Single—source reporting percentage in FY12 and FY11: 24%

Number of product reports derived from PRISM collection and cited as
sources in articles in the President's Daily Brief in FY12: 1.42? (13% of
all SIGINT reports cited as sources in PBS articles — highest single SIGAD
for NSA): In FY11: 1,152 {15% of all SIGINT reports cited as sources in PDB
articles — highest single SIGAD for NSA)

Number of Essential Elements of Information contributed to in FY12:
4,186 (32% of all EEIs for all Information Needs): 22% EEIs addressed

solely by PRISM
Tasking: The number of tasked selectors rose 32% in FY12 to 45,495 as

of Sept 2612

(TS/{SI/INF) SSO HIGHLIGHT — Microsoft Skydrive Collection Now Part of
PRISM Standard Stored Communications Collection

By NAME REDACTED on 2013—33—08 1553

(TS/{SI/INF) Beginning on 7 March 2313, PRISM now collects Microsoft
Skydrive data as part of PRISM's standard Stored Communications collection
package for a tasked FISA Amendments Act Section 782 (FAAIGZ) selector.
This means that analysts will no longer have to make a special request to
350 for this — a process step that many analysts may not have known about.
This new capability will result in a much more complete and timely
collection response from 550 for our Enterprise customers. This success is
the result of the FBI working for many months with Microsoft to get this
tasking and collection solution established. "SkyDrive is a cloud service
that allows users to store and access their files on a variety of devices.
The utility also includes free web app support for Microsoft Office
programs, so the user is able to create, edit, and view Word, PowerPoint,
Excel files without having MS Office actually installed on their device."

{TSf/SII/NF} New Skype Stored Comms Capability For PRISM

 

By [ NAME RevoTED ] on 2013—94—93 @631

 

{TS//SI//NF) PRISM has a new collection capability: Skype stored
communications. Skype stored communications will contain unique data which
is not collected via normal real—time surveillance collection. SSO expects
to receive buddy lists, credit card info, call data records, user account
info. and other material. On 29 March 2813, SSO forwarded approximately 2008
Skype selectors for stored communications to be adjudicated in SV41 and the
Electronic Communications Surveillance Unit (ECSU) at FBI. sv41 had been
working on adjudication for the highest priority selectors ahead of time and
had about 103 ready for ECSU to evaluate. It could take several weeks for
SU41 to work through all 2660 selectors to get them approved. and ECSU will
likely take longer to grant the approvals. As of 2 April, ESCU had approved
over 30 selectors to be sent to Skype for collection. PRISM Skype collection
has carved out a vital niche in NSA reporting in less than two years with
terrorism, Syrian opposition and regime, and exec/special series reports
being the top topics. Over 2880 reports have been issued since April 2811
based on PRISM Skype collection, with 76% of them being single source.

(TS/lSI/lNF) SSO Expands PRISM Skype Targeting Capability

By NAME REDACTED on 2013-04-03 0629

(TSI/SIl/NF) On 15 March 2013, SSO's PRISM program began tasking all
Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype because Skype allows users to log in
using account identifiers in addition to Skype usernames. Until now, PRISM
would not collect any Skype data when a user logged in using anything other
than the Skype username which resulted in missing collection; this action
will mitigate that. In fact, a user can create a Skype account using any
e—mail address with any domain in the world. UTT does not currently allow
analysts to task these non—Microsoft e—mail addresses to PRISM, however,
SSO intends to fix that this summer. In the meantime, NSA, FBI and Dept\of
Justice coordinated over the last six months to gain approval for PRINTAURA
to send all current and future Microsoft PRISM selectors to Skype. This
resulted in about 9860 selectors being sent to Skype and successful
collection has been received which otherwise would have been missed.

(TS/ISII/NF) Microsoft releases new service, affects FAA 702 collection

 

By [ NAMEREDACTED ] on 2012—12—26 0811

 

(TS/ISII/NF) On 31 July, Microsoft (MS) began encrypting web—based chat
with the introduction of the new outlook.com service. This new Secure
Socket Layer (SSL) encryption effectively cut off collection of the new
service for FAA 702 and likely 12333 (to some de ree) for the Intelligence
Community (IC).

 

The SSL solution was applied to all
current FISA and 702/PRISM requirements - no changes to UTT tasking
procedures were required. The SSL solution does not collect server—based
voice/video or file transfers. The MS legacy collection system will remain
in place to collect voice/video and file transfers. As a result there will
be some duplicate collection of text—based chat from the new and legacy
systems which will be addressed at a later date. An increase in collection
volume as a result of this solution has already been noted by CES.

We have enjoyed a long and very productive partnership with NSA in obtaining minimised
access to United States warranted collection against our highest value terrorist targets in
Indonesia. This access has been critical to DSD’s efforts to disrupt and contain the operational
capabilities of terrorists in our region as highlighted by the recent arrest of fugitive Bali

We would veryr much welcome the opportunity to extend that partnership with NSA to cover

on the other, they target us to learn our positions on Middle East problems.

(Si/SI] BLARNEY Team Provides Outstanding Support to Enable
UH Security Council Collection

 

By NAME REDACTED on 2010—05-28 1438

 

 

 

(TS/lSI/INF) With the UN vote on sanctions against Iran
approaching and several countries riding the fence on
making a decision, Ambassador Rice reached out to NSA
requesting SIGINT on those countries so that she could
develop a strategy. With the requirement that this be done
rapidly and within our legal authorities. the BLARNEY team
jumped in to work with organizations and partners both
internal and external to NSA.

(TS/ISI/INF} As OGC. 5V and the TOPIs aggressively worked
through the legal paperwork to expedite four new NSA FISA
court orders for Gabon. Uganda. Nigeria and Bosnia, BLARNEY
Operations Division personnel were behind the scenes
gathering data determining what survey information was
available or could be obtained via their long standing FBI
contacts. As they worked to obtain information on both the
UN Missions in NY and the Embassies in DC, the target
development team greased the skids with appropriate data
flow personnel and all preparations were made to ensure
data could flow to the TOPIs as soon as possible. Several
personnel, one from legal team and one from target
development team were called in on Saturday 22 May to
support the 24 hour drill legal paperwork exercise doing
their part to ensure the orders were ready for the NSA
Director's signature early Monday morning 24 Hay.

(SIISIJ With OGC and 5V pushing hard to expedite these four
orders, they went from the NSA Director for signature to
Dan for SECDEF signature and then to DOJ for signature by
the FISC judge in record time. All four orders were signed
by the judge on Wednesday 26 May! Once the orders were
received by the BLARNEY legal team. they sprung into action
parsing these four orders plus another "nonmal" renewal in
one day. Parsing five court orders in one day —-a BLAHNEY
record! As the BLARNEY legal team was busily parsing court
orders the BLARNEY access management team was working with
the FBI to pass tasking information and coordinate the
engagement with telecommunications partners.

(U) Stealthy Techniques Can Crack Some of SlGlNT’s
Hardest Targets

 

 

 

By: (Uf/FOUO) NMEREDACTED , Chief, Access and Target Development (S3261) ' ; '

IMAGE
REDACTED

 

 

(TS/lSl/JNF) Not all SIGINT tradecraft involves accessing signals and
networks from thousands of miles away... In fact, sometimes it is very - ‘
hands—on (literallyl). Here’s how it works: shipments of computer network 
devices (servers, routers, etc.) being delivered to our targets throughout the world are
intercepted. Next, they are redirected to a secret location where Tailored Access
Operations/Access Operations (A0 — 8326) employees, with the support of the Remote
Operations Center (S321 ), enable the installation of beacon implants directly into our
targets” electronic devices. These devices are then re-packaged and placed back into
transit to the original destination. All of this happens with the support of Intelligence
Community partners and the technical wizards in TAO.

 

Page 149

(TS//SI//NF) Such operations involving supply-chain interdiction are some of the most
productive operations in TAO, because they pre-position access points into hard target
networks around the world.

 

 

 

(TS//SI//NF) Left: Intercepted packages are opened carefully; Right: A “load station”
implants a beacon

Page 149

 

(TS//SI//NF) In one recent case, after several months a beacon implanted through supply-
chain interdiction called back to the NSA covert infrastructure. This call back provided
us access to further exploit the device and survey the network.

Udate software on all Cisco Optical Network Switches.

All of our Cisco ONS SONET multiplexers are experiencing a software bug
that causes them to intermittently drop out.

The mission impact is unknown. While the existing bug doesn't appear to
affect traffic, applying the new software update could. Unfortunately, there is
now way to be sure. We can't simulate the bug in our lab and so it's
impossible to predict exactly what will happen when we apply the software
update. We propose to update one of the nodes in NBP-320 ﬁrst to determine
if the update goes smoothly.

Recently we tried to reset the standby manager card in the HOMEMAKER
node. When that failed, we attempted to physically reseat it. Since it was the
standby card, we did not expect that would cause any problems. However,
upon reseating the card, the entire ONS crashed and we lost all traffic through
the box. It took more than an hour to recover from this failure.

The worst case scenario is that we have to blow away the entire conﬁguration
and start from scratch. Prior to starting our upgrade, we will save the
configuration so that if we have to configure the box from scratch, we can
simply uploade the saved configuration. We estimate that we will be down for
no more than an hour for each node in the system.

3/26/2013 8:16:13 AM

We have tested the upgrade in our lab and it works well. However, we can't
repeat the bug in our lab, so we don't know if we will encounter problems when
we attempt to upgrade a node that is affected by the bug.

(TSIISIIKNFJ 550 HIGHLIGHT - BLARNEY Exploits the Social
Network via Expanded Facebook Collection

(TS/ISIIINF) On 11 March 2311,

  

DPIs are
excited about receiving many content fields. such as chat,
on a sustained basis that had previously only been
occasionally available. Some content will be completely new
including subscriber videos. Taken together, the new
Facebook collection will provide a robust SIGINT
opportunity against our targets — from geolocation based on
their IP addresses and user agent, to collection of all of
their private messages and profile information. Multiple
elements across NSA partnered to ensure the successful
delivery of this data. An NSA representative at FBI
coordinated the rapid development of the collection system:
550's PRINTAURA team wrote new software and made
configuration changes; CES modified their protocol
exploitation systems and the Technology Directorate fast-
tracked upgrades to their data presentation tools so that
OPIs could view the data properly.

What’ 3 the Threat?

I Let’s be blunt — the Western World
(especially the US) gained influence and
made a lot of money via the drafting of
earlier standards.

The US was the major player in shaping
today’s Internet. This resulted in pervasive
exportation of American culture as well as

technology. It also resulted in a lot of money
being made by US entities.

BACKGROUND (U)

(T S//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) A previous SIGINT assessment report on
radicalization indicated that radicalizers appear to be particularly vulnerable in the area
of authority when their private and public behaviors are not consistent. (A) Some of the
vulnerabilities, if exposed, would likely call into question a radicalizer's devotion to the
jihadist cause, leading to the degradation or loss of his authority. Examples of some of
these vulnerabilities include:

- Viewing sexually explicit material online or using sexually explicit persuasive
language when communicating with inexperienced young girls;

0 Using a portion of the donations they are receiving from the susceptible pool to
defray their own personal expenses;

- Charging an exorbitant amount of money for their speaking fees and being
singularly attracted by opportunities to increase their stature; or

0 Being known to base their public messaging on questionable sources or using
language that is contradictory in nature, leaving them open to credibility
challenges.

(TS//SI//REL TO USA, FVEY) Issues of trust and reputation are important when
considering the validity and appeal of the message. It stands to reason that exploiting
vulnerabilities of character, credibility, or both, of the radicalizer and his message could
be enhanced by an understanding of the vehicles he uses to disseminate his message to
the susceptible pool of people and where he is vulnerable in terms of access.
