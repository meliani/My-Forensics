WHY ARE WE TEACHING THIS?

 

 

° 5 Pillars of IO:
— OPSEC
— lVllLDEC
— lVllSO
— E W
— CNO
° The next major conflict will start in cyberspace
— Whether we recognize the signs is another matter
— Recent conflicts have already shown the importance of CNO (Russia/Georgia)

— Think China will make a move on Taiwan without bringing down their communications
networks?

- As lW officers (or DC) — we are expected to know and understand
CNO and communicate with decision makers

- Recently announced plans from Command in Chief and Pentagon
officials emphasize cyber space operations

° Basic 1810/IDC quals are a good foundation, but CO/XO want you to
know more about CNO

— ACK: Used to acknowledge receipt of all package sequences up the number indicated

— PSH: Indicates that that all data already received should be given to the application as soon
as possible. Flushes the buffer.

— URG: Urgent Data. Commonly used for interrupts.

— FIN: Indicates there is no more data to send from that end of the connection. Session
closes after both ends acknowledge Fle

ARP

 

Discuss the following as it pertains to ARP:

— ADDRESS RESOLUTION.”

- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) facilitates the mapping between hardware
addresses (MAC Address) and logical network addresses (IP Addresses). This

mapping can be stored in a file or can determined through ARP broadcast requests on
a local network.

ICMP

 

 

0 Discuss the following as it pertains to ICMP:

— ICMP is a protocol that defines a collection of message types commonly used for network
diagnostics.

- Layer of the OSI model: ICMP (usually) consists of Layer 3 (Network) messages
transported by IR

- Ping: Message Type 8 (request) and 0 (reply). Used to determine if a device is active
on the network.

- Traceroute: Uses a combination of the IP time-to-live (TTL) field and the ICMP
messages 11 (time exceeded) and 3.3 (port unreachable) to determine the route a

packet takes through the network.
