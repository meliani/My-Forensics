(SHREL to USA, FVEY) Subject: NSA Intelligence Relationship with Sweden
(U) Introduction

(SIIREL TO USA. FVEY) NSA’s relationship with the Swedish SIGINT service,
Forsvarets Radioanstalt (F RA), was established in 1954 under the UKUSA agreement.
At that time it was agreed that GCHQ would take the lead for the exchange of COMINT
information and that NSA would take the lead for the ELINT exchange. As of April
2004. NSA. GCHQ and the FRA agreed to dissolve this part of the UKUSA agreement
and hold bilateral exchanges on both COMINT and ELINT.

(TSHSWN F) NSA's relationship with the FRA. an extremely competent. technically
innovative. and trusted Third Party partner. continues to grow. The FRA provided NSA
with access to its cable collection in 2011. providing unique collection on high-priority
Russian targets such as leadership, internal politics, and energy.

. FRA‘s efforts against counter-terrorism (CT) targets continue to expand. and
new legislation enacted in January 2013 has improved its ability to work directly with the
Swedish internal security service (SAPO). NSA’s Data Acquisition is actively engaged
with the FRA. which has numerous collection sites and is proﬁcient in collecting a wide
variety of communications.

(U) Key Issues

(TSl/SINNF) The FRA continues to place more emphasis on cyber. NSA‘s National
Threat Operations Center (NTOC) and FRA analysts have an ongoing exchange
discussing malware topics. The FRA is positioning itself to become the cyber defense
authority in Sweden and hopes to receive the Swedish government mandate in the near
future.
