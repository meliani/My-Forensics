(TS/lSI/lREL) For an overview of QUANTUM and how shooters ﬁt into the
greater QUANTUM infrastructure, see QUANTUM Operational Design

on the ROC Wiki.

(TS/lSI/lREL) A QUANTUM shooter is a host computer on the internet that has
been implanted with a STRAITBIZARRE (SBZ) conﬁgured to receive commands
from TURBINE, via SURPLUSHANGARJHANGARSURPLUS diodes, and the

Once a box has been identiﬁed for use as a QUANTUM shooter, an SBZ is
conﬁgured using FELONYCROWBAR along with a Deployed Node Document
(DND), an XML conﬁg ﬁle. The FELONYCROWBAR GUI and build scripts
handle some aspects of conﬁguration, such as which SBZ modules to include,
but it also needs the DND to conﬁgure most aspects of the communications
links. For an upgrade, an old DND can be modiﬁed by hand, but for a new
build, a new DND will need to be generated in the NCC (with some changes by
hand). Once the core and "bin" customization SBZ ﬁles are generated (usually
a zip ﬁle output from FELONYCROWBAR), an interactive operator can deploy
these to the shooter box.

(U) Infrastructure Components

FREEFLOW

(TS//SI//REL) There are four operational FREEFLOW threads (plus one for
PASSAGEHILL testing):

I Thread A, the original FREEFLOW thread (early 2008), associated with
the old ROC/MIT covert infrastructure (FORESTPLACE/FUSSYKEEL).

I Thread B, the QUANTUM thread

I Thread C, FINGERGNOME high—to—low transfer

I Thread D, the new FREEFLOW 2.0 thread, associated with new covert
infrastructure (FROZENEARTH).

The FREEFLOW Conﬂuence page (https://conﬂuence—nf.tao.nsa/display
IROC/FREEFLOW) has a good overview picture, especially showing the
differences between the old FREEFLOW (1.0, the purplish—gray area) and the
new FREEFLOW (2.0, the yellow area). The QUANTUM thread is 1.0 for now,
but will eventually be upgraded and this whole process will change.

FREEFLOW components important for understanding QUANTUM shooters are
described below as they apply to the shooter build process, and a good
overview of the QUANTUM infrastructure can be found here

QUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - WikiInfo

(TS/lSI,0C//REL) CHIMNEYPOOL uses its own version of RFC (CHM RPC) for
communications, which ride on the FRIEZERAMP Network Stack
. CHIMNEYPOOL—

compliant nodes are referred to by their four—byte FREIZERAMP (FRZ)
addresses, which are usually represented in hex.

(TS//SI//REL) Links are half—duplex comms paths that need to be conﬁgured
for two CHM nodes to be able to talk. These can be encrypted or unencrypted
and are usually spit out correctly by the NCC DND, along with the Security
Associations that allow them to communicate with the NCC (keys are
generated by the NCC). To communicate with TURBINE, the SBZ also needs to
have two additional Security Associations conﬁgured —— one to communicate
with SURPLUSHANGAR and one for HANGARSURPLUS.

MIT) usually conﬁgures the HS/SH side, which generates the keys. You'll need
to conﬁgure SAs to match -keys, which can be done either by modifying
the DND, or post—deployment via commands directly to the SBZ via NCC (see

Dave).

(U) NCC
(TS//SI//REL) The GENIE Network Conﬁguration Center (NCC) manages

CHIMNEYPOOL comms links for all STRAITBIZARRE implants, via
MIDDLEMAN. Information on the NCC is often out of date (the "new" NCC will

be on the high side and will hopefully be easier to update), so onl use the NCC
to generate a DND if you can't modify an old conﬁg, either from”
or from /targets/zombiearmy to ﬁnd the one the operator put on e ox. ou
also need the NCC to manage the links.

QUANTUM shooters. Information about these is NOFORN and is found in a
spreadsheet updated by— You'll need to conﬁgure the shooter to
send comms via the nearest gateway —— choose the gateway that has the lowest
latency to the shooter, based on the results of latency tests (which are not
expected to change frequently).

(S/lSI/IREL) TURBINE
The Conﬂuence TURBINE —

page describes what happens when an SBZ calls back.

(U) How To

(TS/ISI/IREL) Connecting to the QUANTUM NCC

I Your WAITAUTO box needs to be able to talk to the QUANTUM NCC
. You may need an MITHelp ticket to get the ﬁrewall to allow
this connection.
I Use Putty to SSH to the NCC box (username: ncc_user,- email _
- for password) with the following options:
I Connection —> SSH —> check box to "Enable X11 forwarding"
I Connection —> SSH —> X display location: set this to <Your

WAITAUTO IP address>:0
I cd /opt/ncc/ and run ./start_gui.sh. User name (either user1 or user2)
depends on who else is using the box —— check with the POCs above.

(TS/lSI/IREL) Getting a DND from the NCC

I Follow instructions in the document in References, or conﬁrm that the

settings are correct.
I Once your changes have been saved, in the terminal window, run the

following:

:cd lopt/ncc/util

I./build_sbz_bin.sh WebSnipe <your node cover term> localhost (where "WebSnipe" is the target cover td
' I

I The resulting DND will be in /tmp (WebSnipe_<node cover
term>_DeployedNode#.xml). Copy this to a thumb drive and upload to

RSS.
(TS/lSI/IREL) Getting a DND from [targets for an upgrade
I Check either FELONYCROWBAR or /targets/ZOMBIEARMY/<node>

/ops/<date>/techdata if they have it there from a previous op. This doesn't
contain the DND, but it contains an XML which can be used to back out

the DND.

I Send zip ﬁle to— to be run through the Fiptrix tool to
generate a DND XML ﬁle.

(TS/lSI/IREL) Updating a DND from the NCC for
FELONYCROWBAR

I (TS/lSI/IREL) Add "implantId" element as the ﬁrst child node, and
"implantUuid" as the last

I (TS/ISI/IREL) Add "<sbzXﬁlConﬁg>
<defaultDestAddr>00100005<ldefaultDestAddr></sbzXﬁlConﬁg>"

I (TS/lSI/IREL) Add Security Associations for HANGARSURPLUS (00 for
send) and SURPLUSHANGAR (02 for receive)

I You are now ready to upload to FELONYCROWBAR for your SBZ build.

(Sl/SI/IREL) Getting Link Info and Modifying Links

(TS/ISI/IREL) This is mostly done using the Wrench/Screwdriver tab ("Rudy") in
the NCC.

(Sl/SI/IREL) I have a FRZ address. How do I get a linkEndId?

(U) Other notes
(U) MHS

(SI/REL) There is no HANGARSURPLUS in the MHS case. GCHQ basically does
not want it to call back. They have their own method of determining shooter
health.

50f6

QUANTUM Shooter SBZ Notes - Wikilnfo

I Disable the CCFP since it requires the node to ack back through the
HANGARSURPLUS (which doesn't exist in the MHS conﬁguration).

I For good measure, conﬁgure only the receive Security Associations and
UDP link (Low Proxy to SBZ), and none of the send SAs/links.

I Conﬁgure BonjourMod to not send heartbeats.

I Conﬁgure szLogMod to not exﬁl logs.

I Do not include szXﬁlMod if possible, or set Min Priority To Exﬁl to 16.

I Do not include any of the default modules (SiphonCauseway, ShinyObject,
etc.).

(U) Look into testing using CHIMNEYPOOL Python script ("chim.py"?) to issue
commands.
