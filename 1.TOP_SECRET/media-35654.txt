targets for capture -- all in a day's work? Then you would be working in the Remote
Operations Center (ROC)!

(TS/[SD ROC personnel:

0 Remotely penetrate hard targets and classiﬁed foreign networks and extract
sensitive SIGINT data.

- Remotely exploit and collect SIGINT data of both foreign country and terrorist
computer and telephony networks.

- Geolocate high-value Counterterrorism targets around the world.

0 Provide real-time support in the apprehension or rendition of high-proﬁle
terrorists.

- Manage, operate, and maintain the covert infrastructure used to conduct
network operations.

(TS/[SD The ROC provides a crucial piece of the puzzle in helping the Agency
achieve the Transformation 3.0 objective of Global Network Dominance. ROC
exploitation and collection requirements have grown at an unbelievable rate. The
recent opening of a new ROC workspace (see a related article appearing on NSA
Daily today) was essential in allowing an increase in operations, strengthening of
the 24/7 operations pace, and expanding operational partnerships with NSA/CSS
Texas, NSA/CSS Hawaii, and NSA/CSS Georgia.

(TS/[SD The ROC has already enjoyed great success in its CNE, CNA and CND
(Computer Network Exploitation/Attack/Defense) operations, and is bound to
achieve even more in its new facilities. Their motto says it all: "Your data is our
data, your equipment is our equipment - anytime, any place, by any legal means."
