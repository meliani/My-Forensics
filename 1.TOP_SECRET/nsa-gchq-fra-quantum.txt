Review SlD’s goals for this quarterly.

Note that just about all of the accomplishments we are presenting respond to some aspect ofSlD’s

is to simply maintain a viable relationship that we can rely on should we need it in the future. And that
these are only some of the accomplishments for FY13...there are way too many to address in just an

When it comes to discussing the challenges and roadblocks that we believe are going to make it difficult
if not impossible to accomplish specific items, the causative factors are divided between NSA and
partner budget cuts, legal and policy impediments on the partner side, and in a few cases partner
unwillingness to cooperate or meet their obligations to us.

in fact NSA’s goal all along has been to transition this effort to a bilat with the Swedish partner.
