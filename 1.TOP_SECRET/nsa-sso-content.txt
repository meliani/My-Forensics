Yahoo Webmessenger

 

Update data sent to individuals logged into Yahoo’s Instant
Messenger service online

— Online contact status, unread emails in Yahoo inbox

— Usually small sessions (2—4kB)

Sporadic collection (30,000 — 60,000 sessions per day)

Intermittent bursts of collection against contacts of targets
— Large numbers of sessions (20,000+) against a single targeted selector
— Not collected against the target (online presence/unread email from target)
— No owner attribution (metadata value limited to fact-of comms for emails,
online presence events for buddies)
Over a dozen selectors detasked in two weeks
— Because a target’s contact was using/idling on Yahoo Webmessenger
— Several very timely selectors (Libyan transition, Greek financial related)

Address Books

- Email address books for most major webmail are collected as
stand-alone sessions (no content present*)

- Address books are repetitive, large, and metadata-rich
- Data is stored multiple times (MARINA/MAINWAY, PINWALE, CLOUDs)
- Fewer and fewer address books attributable to users, targets

- Address books account for ~ 22% of SSO’s major accesses (up
from ~ 12% in August)

Buddy Lists,|nboxes

 

- Unlike address books, frequently contain content data
— Offline messages, buddy icon updates, other data included
— Webmail inboxes increasingly include email content

— Most collection is due to the presence of a target on a buddy list where the
communication is not to, from, or about that target

- NSA collects, on a representative day, ~ 500,000 buddylists and
inboxes

— More than 90% collected because tasked selectors identified only as
contacts (not communicant, content, or owner)

- Identifying buddylists and inboxes without content (or without
useful content) an ongoing challenge

Scenario: -@yahoo

- -@yahoo.com has a number of Yahoo groups in his/her
contact list, some with many hundreds or thousands of
members

- At DS-ZOOB in particular, collection spiked as:

The initial spam messages were sent (and collected)
lnboxes of email recipients were viewed by- contact list

Messages were sometimes viewed, but more often sent as precached
views on Google and Yahoo (along with inboxes)

lnboxes where the recipient did not delete the spam message continued to
be collected every time they were viewed

Some recipients added @yahoo.com to their address books
(possibly as a spam defeat?) — address books were collected every time

Scenario: _@yahoo

@yahoo.com emergency detasked from DS-ZOOB and
US—31 71 at 13:04Z on 20 Oct

Numerous first-order address books and inboxes collected
meant tasked selectors on address books or buddy lists of
contacts of @yahoo.com also affected:

— @yahoo.com and _@gmail.com emergency
detasked off US-3171 at 13:1 OZ on 20 Sep

Memorializing to PINWALE only address books and inboxes
owned by target selectors would have reduced PINWALE
volumes 90°/o+

— Site XKEYSCOREs would buffer data for SIGDEV purposes

— Metadata from known owner address books and inboxes stored regardless
